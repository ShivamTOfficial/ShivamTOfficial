    <h1>Welcome to Shivam's Github Page!</h1>
    <h2>About Me</h2>
<p>I am a Machine Learning Engineer with a passion for building and deploying intelligent systems that improve people's lives. I have [X] years of experience in developing ML models, working with big data, and implementing end-to-end ML solutions.</p>

<h2>My Work</h2>
<p>I have worked on a variety of projects in different industries, including healthcare, finance, and retail. Some of my recent work includes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Developing a deep learning model to predict the likelihood of hospital readmissions for patients with chronic conditions.</li>
  <li>Building a recommendation system using collaborative filtering to improve customer retention and sales for an e-commerce company.</li>
  <li>Implementing a real-time fraud detection system for a financial services organization using anomaly detection algorithms.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>
<p>I have extensive experience working with a variety of ML tools and technologies, including:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Python: pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch</li>
  <li>Big Data: Apache Spark, Hadoop, Hive</li>
  <li>Cloud Platforms: AWS, GCP, Azure</li>
  <li>Data Visualization: Tableau, Matplotlib, Seaborn</li>
</ul>

<h2>My Approach</h2>
<p>I believe in an iterative approach to building ML models, starting with exploratory data analysis and feature engineering, followed by model selection and evaluation. I also prioritize scalability, reliability, and maintainability in my ML solutions, ensuring that they can be easily deployed and maintained over time.</p>
